Each second (tick) = 1 minute in game. Make it last a whole season. Or have some kinda real prestige system that is meaningful.

save/load feature. Kinda shit with JS/jQuery but maybe React/Angular would be better for saving states.

scale mirror upgrades (gives increased efficiency per)

fix annulment flipping rate, should be even.

make flipping tab better, somehow allow players to only flip one of the higher currencies, or set a floor/cap.

Change IIQ/Incubator upgrades, more expensive to start but price scales less.

Make currency flipping upgrade price increase slower.

upgrade to consume conquerer's orbs automatically.

probably nerf melvin efficiency.

investigate Augs not flipping properly (pretty sure this is just cause high droprate and low 5:1 sell rate tho)

cannot tell how much currency you have on flipping page, either highlight the text red, or show the currency somehow. Prefer the first option due to clutter.

Communicate the map currency upgrades better.

togger to hide/show purchasable upgrades

https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/gbntna/idle_exile_an_incremental_game_based_on_poe/fp8sd7u/ - investigate this comment, I guess sometimes exiles overlevel and break, not sure how that can happen without cheats though, 99->100 exp is huge.

phone support, low priotiry. too much information to display nicely.

forgot to close "<div class="mdl-layout\_\_header-row">", probably why the upgrade tables broke on FireFox. Need to figure out why that's broken on FF if not.

maybe some kinda global leaderboard, would need a server to be able to write to a .txt or DB tho.

more end game upgrades/scaling.

button that turns off all flips.

clean up some functions, I feel like I got sloppy with upgrades/crafting - these functions can be condensed, lots of repitition here.
